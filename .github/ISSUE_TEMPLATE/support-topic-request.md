# Support Topic Request

Fill out each section to describe a request for a new article on a support topic.

The hpc-support repo is a public repository; secrets should not be discussed here.

## Description:

A short description of the topic.

## Related to:

Links to relevant tickets in Remedyforce, or discussions in Slack, or discussions in Teams.

## Existing resources:

Links to any existing articles, for example on Confluence or the [UCL Research Computing Documentation](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/), that partially satisfy this request. There may be none.

## Recommendation: (optional)

If no article exists for this issue in Confluence or the [UCL Research Computing Documentation](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/), a new page should be created in the [hpc-support wiki on Github](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/hpc-support/wiki).

If an article does exist in Confluence or the [UCL Research Computing Documentation](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/) that completely covers the topic, comment on this issue with a link to the article and close the issue.

If it is not clear whether an article exists that completely covers this topic, discuss in the comments to determine whether a new page should be written or whether the existing documentation is sufficient.
